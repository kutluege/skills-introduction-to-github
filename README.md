# Hi there, I'm Ege Kutlu! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey! I'm Ege Kutlu, currently pursuing my master’s degree at Boğaziçi University, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. When I'm not buried under a pile of research papers or tweaking code at midnight, you'll find me exploring the fascinating world of AI agents and algorithmic trading. 

I love building smart systems that can make decisions, learn from data, and even trade in the markets faster (and hopefully smarter!) than any human. My curiosity often takes me from designing deep neural networks to experimenting with new agent architectures and backtesting trading strategies. 

I'm always open to collaboration, sharing ideas, or just nerding out about the latest AI trends.
